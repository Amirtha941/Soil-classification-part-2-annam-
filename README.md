## 📌 Objective

This project aims to classify images of soil into one of seven categories using a deep learning model. The solution was developed as part of the Soil Classification competition on Kaggle, where evaluation is based on the **minimum F1 score across all classes**.

---

## 🧠 Approach

- **Pretrained CNN Model**: We use ResNet18 pretrained on ImageNet for transfer learning.
- **Data Augmentation**: Random flip, rotation, and color jitter to improve generalization.
- **Metric Focus**: Optimized for **minimum F1 score** to ensure every class performs well.
- **Modular Design**: All logic is broken into reusable components.
